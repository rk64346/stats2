    "skewness in data is a statistical measure that describes the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a random variable. In simpler terms, it indicates the degree to which a dataset's distribution deviates from symmetry around its mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative Skewness (Left-skewed): If the left tail (tail on the lower end of the distribution) is longer or fatter than the right tail, the data is said to be negatively skewed. In a negatively skewed distribution, the mean is typically less than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Positive Skewness (Right-skewed): If the right tail (tail on the higher end of the distribution) is longer or fatter than the left tail, the data is said to be positively skewed. In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is typically greater than the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero Skewness (Symmetrical): If the dataset is perfectly symmetrical, it has zero skewness. This means the distribution is evenly balanced on both sides of the mean, and the mean, median, and mode are all equal."
